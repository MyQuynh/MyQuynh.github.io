                <h1 class="text-center text-h1">What is my interest in IT ?</h1>
                <p class="text-center">Nearly 10 years ago, I have had a huge love with Artificial Intelligent after I watched Wall - E on Disney Channel. That movie shows us about human lives in the future when the robots become advanced which is possible to replace people in every single work of life. When I was 8 or 9 years old, I have thought that it is very cool if I could make one like that for myself so I can enjoy my life without doing anything. Although there are some changes in my thoughts about this idea, l excited about this kind of subject because I am quite messy so I want a robot which can help to clean my room. Therefore, I started to learn Pascal in secondary school and engaged in some robotic competitions in highschool like Robotacon and SRobot. Furthermore, I also participated in IT Bootcamp at SaigonTech college to learn about IoT and I have made a balanced robot with my team.</p>

                <!--Choose RMIT-->
                <h1 class="text-center text-h1">Why did I choose RMIT ?</h1>
                <p class="text-center">There are 3 main reasons why I choose to study at RMIT. First of all, I really love the international environment of this school because I can improve my English skills, it makes me feel more confident when I communicate with foreign people. Moreover, maybe I can learn more and more languages, which is very helpful for me. For example, I will know who is cursing me though they do not use English. Secondly, RMIT Vietnam tuition fee is cheaper than studying abroad but I still have the same knowledge as RMIT Australia. Finally, studying at RMIT, I will have more time to improve my practical skills by doing group assignments and totally focus on my major because I do not have to learn unnecessary subjects like philosophy like studying at other schools.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item1">
                <!--Expectation-->
                <h1 class="text-center text-h1">What do I expect to learn ?</h1>
                <p class="text-center">Firstly, my top priority is learning to program because I want to have a beautiful code that would help my teammates a lot for understanding. Secondly, machine learning could be one subject that I should study because this kind of subject can help me have a foundation knowledge of AI. After that, I think learning about security is very important. Everything will have both sides and AI is also if I cannot prevent hackers, it would become dangerous not only for me but also for other people. Finally, it is necessary to study mobile software in Android and iOS because it can support AI and mobile software tend to become more and more developed in the future.</p>

            <li>Great Analysts and Abstract Thinkers – Logicians view the world as an enormous and complicated machine.

                Objective – Logicians’ analysis, creativity and open-mindedness aren’t the tools of some quest for ideology or emotional validation.

            I don’t understand myself quite well so these results of personality tests have a big meaning to me. It helps me to acknowledge myself and improve my weakness. In the “16 Persionality test”, according to the result, it shows my strength and weakness. Thanks to the test, I can know what I am good at and make beneficials from that. In the second test about “Learning style”, this test is important because it helps me to understand which is the best method to study effectively. Finally the third test, which is “Creativity test”, shows me what I am lacking and as a result of it, I know how to improve myself.Overall,  all these tests may not influence my behavior in a team. However, it can help me to make decisions when I form a team. I can recruit members who can strengthen my weak side and I can be the one they need to improve their weakness too, it is called mutual benefits.

                My project would be a web application called CodeX that could help users in Vietnam learn how to code and program. This application will provide many walkthrough tutorials to learn different programming languages such as C++, Java, Python,etc. Moreover, at the end of each session, to know if the users understand what they have learned, CodeX will provide several quizzes to help users remember the course easier.
                Besides that, it will have many mentors available for you to ask how to start coding, which is the best language for you to learn. Moreover, you can match with somebody that starts the same program path as you. Therefore, you can learn something new from others and tell them about what you have learned, because one of the best ways to learn something is teaching it to somebody else. If you finish our tutorials, there are many challenges or pet projects to do as practice makes perfect.

                We are now standing on the brick of four industrial revolutions.Therefore, the demand of computer and information technology has been currently increasing. According to VietNam’s News, Viet Nam needs more than 400,000 information technology (IT) in 2020 and this number will become greater for the next 10 years. Not all Vietnamese people have the chance to study English so learning through video tutorials or reading documents is quite hard for them to understand especially for the young. This application will be the essential tool for their start of exploring the IT world. Moreover, for those who want to change their career path to IT or lost basic knowledge about IT, CodeX provides many courses which take 3-4 hours to help them keep back on track.

                        Every week, the online coding contests are organized. It can be individual or users can form the team to participate in the competition. This feature not only helps users to apply what they have learned but also to know their ability. Therefore, they can modify the study plan to develop themselves. Furthermore, the best thing about joining the competition is that users can expand their net-working. They will know more people and learn new things from others.

                        This feature is the service which helps developers who are seeking for a job or finding an internship. There is going to be a range of job recruitments from web developers, game developers,full stack,etc which depend on what users’ career path are. Moreover, CodeX also provides the feature “Job near you” so it will make users easy to search things. This not only provides jobs in Vietnam, if developers want to have an opportunity to work overseas, there will be jobs available for them too.

                Software : This application will be developed using HTML, CSS and Javascript to build a web application. Beside, to store the data of the customers or the service itself, it would also be used MongoDB or SQL and PHP. Moreover, for creating the online interpreter, I can use the API of the third service such as <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/api/docs">Hackkerank</a> or <a href="https://www.hackerearth.com/docs/wiki/developers/legacy/">HackerEarth</a>. <br /> <br />
                Hardware: To store thousand of thousand data, there would be lots of hard disk. Beside from that, to provide better experiment for the customers , it should have a good RAM since it have a lot of feature which may slow down the application

            <p>
                <strong>Hard-working</strong> : I think this is the most important skill to be an IT employee. If I don’t have this skill, the project will be procrastinated and never be done. Therefore, the project may be fail <br /><br />
                <strong>Patient</strong>: Beside the hard-working, there I should be patient too because I have to work under a lot of pressure which may decrease my motivation toward the project. Being patient can get me overcome it and get back on what I started <br /><br />
                <strong>Technical in HTML, CSS, Javascript, MongoDB and some other programming languages </strong>: Those languages are the main core if I want to build up CodeX. As a result of it, without that skill, I can not do anything.

            <p class="grid-item2">
                If CodeX is successful, there might be more and more people working in the IT industry which meet the requirement of this career for the next 10 years. Therefore, the IT industry in Vietnam will be developed and reached to the position that could be compared to other developed countries such as China, America, Russia, etc. Consequently, robots for housework which helps saving time, self-driving cars which are very useful for those who do not know to drive cars, virtual assistants like Jarvis in Marvel movies to arrange your work,.. those things in the next 5 years might be common in Vietnam. Finally, with those services made in Vietnam, it can be bought from other countries which can bring benefits for Vietnam’s economic efficiency.
